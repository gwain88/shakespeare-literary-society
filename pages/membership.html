    <p class="subpageTitle">Membership in the Shakespeare Literary Society</p>
    
    <p class="subpageDescription">Founded on April 23, 1864 in a secret location, the Shakespeare Literary Society is the world's oldest literary society devoted to Shakespearemania.</p>       
        
    <p class="subpageDescription">In pursuit of its mission, the Society's members meet regularly to discuss Shakespeare's works and share information regarding the latest productions of plays, readings, and literary critical works.</p>
    
    <p class="subpageDescription">We are the organization responsible for producing the famed and notorious "Shakespeare Scenes," the annual, free public performance at the Poet's Walk in New York's Central Park.  The performance takes place on April 23 each year.  As any fan of Shakespeare knows, April 23 marks the Great Bard's birthday as well as the date of his passing.</p>

    <p class="subpageDescription">Membership in our Society is by invitation only.  The identities of our members are known only among ourselves.  For over two centuries, no member has ever disclosed his or her identity to an outsider.  Our oath to remain secret is solemn, iron-clad, and remains so since our founding in 1864.</p>
